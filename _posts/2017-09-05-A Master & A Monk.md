**<u>"Don't insist upon your own fixed ideas.<br/>
 If your mind is broad it can easily embrace the entire world.""</u>**<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**<u>- Zen Proverb</u>**	

A master is who broadens the vision and strengthens the endurance of a disciple. A master inculcates the discipline essential for the intelligence.

There is a subtle difference between a teacher and a guru. Teacher is just a profession and guru is a way of living. Teacher is of the west and a guru is of the east. 

**Relationship between guru and disciple is intimate like love**. The reverence that is felt is like love but one difference: love is parallel and reverence is one above the other. Love creates friendship, because the lover and the loved one are on the same level. Reverence is also a kind of love but with a great difference: it is not on he same level, one person is higher. If there's loving intimacy with the personality above, the reverence is not expected or demanded, but it is automatically created around the guru.

A guru is not aware of his guru-ship. A guru cannot claim that he is a guru. A guru has attended the condition of egolessness. 

**The relationship between the disciple and the guru is a relationship of intimate trust.** That doesn’t mean blind faith, because the guru never expects you to believe in him — that is not an expectation.  Guru is always saying, “Jump into it! Do it!” But before you can jump, trust is needed or you will not jump. 

Reverence for a teacher is not possible. It is forced, artificial.

For a guru, it happens automatically in the mind of the disciple. It's the charisma of the guru which attracts the disciple like gravity. A teacher is knowledgeable but a master is intuitive and meditative. A teacher is ingrained with machine-like monotony. 

**Even concepts such as beauty are not totally expressible** 
If you have seen a flower, you can say it is beautiful. But that does not convey anything. Your words never convey the actual realization of the moment because they can mean anything to the person to whom they are conveyed. A person who has never seen beauty in any flower will hear your words and understand the meaning of them without understanding anything at all, because the word beauty does not mean anything to him.

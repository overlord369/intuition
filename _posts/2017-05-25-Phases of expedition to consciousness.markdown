Gautam Buddha left his palace when he was twenty-nine years old. 
Jesus started his teachings when he was thirty years old; Zarathustra went into the mountains when he was thirty years old.

> There is something significant about the age of thirty, or near-about.
	Just as at the age of fourteen, one becomes sexually mature. If we take life as it has been taken traditionally, that it consists of seventy years... those who have watched life very deeply have found that every seven years, there is a change, a turning.
    
	The first seven years are innocent. The second seven years, the child is very much interested in enquiring, in questioning – curiosity. After the fourteenth up to the twenty-first year, he has the most powerful sexuality. The highest peak of sexuality, you will be surprised to know, is near-about eighteen or nineteen years. And humanity has been trying to avoid that period by providing educational programs, colleges, universities – keeping boys and girls apart. That is the time when their sexuality and their sexual energy is at the highest point.
	In those seven years, from fourteen to twenty-one, they could have experienced sexual orgasm very easily. Sexual orgasm is a glimpse which can create in you the urge to find more blissful spaces, because in sexual orgasm two things disappear: your ego disappears, your mind disappears, and time stops – just for a few seconds.
But these three are the important things. Two things disappear completely; you are no more ”I” – you are, but there is no sense of the ego. Your mind is there but there are no thoughts, just a deep stillness. Suddenly, because the ego disappears and the mind stops, time stops, too. To experience time, you need changing thoughts of the mind; otherwise, you cannot experience the movement of time.
Orgasm is the glimpse into consciousness.
	Then from twenty-one to twenty-eight, the other seven years, one searches, because sexual orgasm is biological. Soon you will lose the energy and you will not be able to have the orgasm. Secondly, it is dependent on somebody else, a woman, a man; it is destructive of your freedom; it is at a very high cost. So if a man grows very naturally – is allowed to grow naturally – from twenty-one to twenty-eight, he will search and seek ways and means, of how to transcend physiology, biology, and yet remain capable of moving into deeper orgasmic experiences.
	From twenty-eight to the age thirty-five, all these people – Gautam Buddha, Zarathustra, Lao Tzu, Chuang Tzu, Jesus – all have moved in higher planes of being. And just not to be bothered, not to be hindered by people, not to be distracted, they moved into the mountains – into aloneness. According to me, it was not against life – they were simply searching a silent space where there were no distractions and they could find the greatest orgasmic experience... what William James has called ”the oceanic orgasm,” in which you completely disappear into the ocean of existence – just like a dewdrop slipping from a lotus leaf into the ocean.

> So the age thirty is not just incidental. All great seekers have left in the search between twenty-eight and thirty-five. That is the period of seeking, searching – searching something that is not of the body, but of the spirit.

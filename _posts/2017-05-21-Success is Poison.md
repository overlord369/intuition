If the left-hemisphere brain goes on dominating you, you will live a very successful life -- so successful 
that by the time you are forty you will have ulcers; by the time you are forty-five you will have had at least 
one or two heart-attacks; by the time you are fifty you will be almost dead -- but successfully dead. You 
may become a great scientist, but you will never become a great being. You may accumulate enough of 
wealth, but you will lose all that is of worth. You may conquer the whole world like an Alexander, but your own inner territory will remain unconquered. 

There are many attractions to follow the left-hemisphere brain -- that is the worldly brain. It is more 
concerned with things: cars, money, houses, power, prestige. That is the orientation of the man who in India 
we call a GRUSTHA, a householder. 
The right-hemisphere brain is the orientation of the SANNYASIN. one who is more interested in his 
own inner being, his inner peace, his blissfulness, and is less concerned about things. If they come easily, 
good; if they don't come that is also good. He is more concerned with the moment, less concerned with the 
future; more concerned with the poetry of life, less concerned with the arithmetic of it.

A man was sitting with his friend in a cafeteria drinking tea. He studied his cup and said with a sigh, _'Ah, my friend, life is like a cup of tea.'_

The other considered that for a moment and then said, _'But why? Why is life like a cup of tea?'_

> **The first man replied, 'How should I know? Am I a philosopher?'**

The right-hemisphere brain only makes statements about facts, it cannot give you reasons. If you ask, '_Why_?' it can only remain silent, there comes no response from it. If you are walking and you see a lotus flower and you say, 'Beautiful!' -- and somebody says, 'Why?' what will you do? You will say, 'How am I to know? Am I a philosopher?' It is a simple statement, a very simple statement, in itself total, complete. There is no reason behind it and no result beyond it, it is a simple statement of fact. 

Look at the gospels and the statements of Jesus -- they are simple. He says, '_My God is in heaven. I am his son, he is my father. Don't ask why._' He will not be able to prove it in a court, he will simply say, 'I know.' If you ask him by whom he has been told, by what authority he says these things, he will say, '_It is by my own authority. I have no other authority._' That is the problem when a man like Jesus moves in the world. The rational mind cannot understand, he was not crucified for any other reason.

'Ah, my friend, life is like a cup of tea.' 
￼
The other considered that for a moment and then said, 'But why? Why is life like a cup of tea?' 
￼
The first man replied, 'How should I know? Am I a philosopher?' 
e beautiful, then everything takes a luminous quality. 
Ordinary pebbles become diamonds; ordinary rocks are no longer ordinary -- nothing is ordinary. If you look from the right hemisphere, everything becomes Divine, sacred. Religion is from the right hemisphere. 
A man was sitting with his friend in a cafeteria drinking tea. He studied his cup and said with a sigh. The right-hemisphere brain only makes statements about facts, it cannot give you reasons. If you ask, 'Why?' it can only remain silent, there comes no response from it. If you are walking and you see a lotus flower and you say, 'Beautiful!' -- and somebody says, 'Why?' what will you do? You will say, 'How am I to know? Am I a philosopher?' It is a simple statement, a very simple statement, in itself total, complete. There is no reason behind it and no result beyond it, it is a simple statement of fact.

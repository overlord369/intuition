Life is like love, life is like happiness. Life is existence - no goal. And once you can understand this your ways of living will change totally, because if there is no purpose in life itself there is no need to create a purpose for your individual life also - no need. Because of individual purposes you become tense, something has to be achieved. Then an achieving mind is created which is always trying to achieve something or other. And whenever something is achieved again the mind asks, "Now what?

What is to be achieved now?" It cannot remain with itself, it has to go on achieving.

This achieving mind will never be blissful, it will always be tense. And whenever something is achieved the achieving mind will feel frustrated, because now new goals have to be invented. This is happening in America. Many of the goals of the past century have been achieved, so America is in a deep frustration. All the goals of the founding fathers who created America and the American constitution are almost achieved. In America the society has become affluent for the first time in the whole history of mankind. Almost everybody is rich. The poor man in America is a rich man here in India.

The goals have almost been achieved - now what to do? Society has become affluent: food is there, shelter is there, everybody has got a car, radio, refrigerator, tv - now what to do? A deep frustration is felt, some other goals are needed. And there seem to be no goals. Instead of one car you can have two cars - a two-car garage has become the goal - or you can have two houses, but that will be achieved within ten years. Whatsoever the goal it can be achieved. Then the achieving mind feels frustrated. What to do now? It again needs a goal, and you have to invent a goal.

So the whole of American business now depends on inventing goals. Give people goals - that's what advertisements and the whole business of advertising is doing. Create goals, seduce people:

"Now this is the goal! You must have this, otherwise life is purposeless!" They start running, because they have an achieving mind. But where does it lead? It leads into more and more neurosis.

Only a nonachieving mind can be at peace. But a nonachieving mind is possible only with the background of a cosmic purposelessness. If the whole existence is purposeless then there is no need for you to be purposeful. Then you can play, you can sing and dance, you can enjoy, you can love and live, and there is no need to create any goal. Here and now, this very moment, the ultimate is present. If you are available the ultimate can enter you. But you are not available here; your mind is somewhere in the future, in some goal.

Life has got no purpose and this is the beauty of it. If there was some purpose life would have been mean - just futile. It is not a business, it is a play. In India we have been calling it leela. Leela means a cosmic play... as if God is playing. Energy overflowing, not for some purpose, just enjoying itself; just a small child playing - for what purpose? Running after butterflies, collecting colored stones on the beach, dancing under the sun, running under the trees, collecting flowers - for what purpose?

Ask a child. He will look at you as if you are a fool. There is no need for purpose.
